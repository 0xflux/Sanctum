//! # Sanctum Process Monitor
//!
//! The `process_monitor` module implements a Windows-kernel driver component
//! that tracks process lifecycles and applies “ghost-hunting” heuristics to detect
//! syscall-hooking evasion.  
//!
//! For more info on GhostHunting, see my blog post:
//! https://fluxsec.red/edr-syscall-hooking
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Maintains a global map of `Process` metadata  
//! - Spawns a monitoring thread to time syscall events  
//! - Exposes APIs to register new processes, remove exited ones, and feed
//!   Ghost Hunting telemetry
